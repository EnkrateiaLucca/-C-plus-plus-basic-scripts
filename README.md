# Set of introductory C++ scripts written from a python perspective
## Overview
Repository for my medium post: ["A Quick Pythonic Intrdocution to C++"](https://medium.com/@lucas.soares/a-quick-pythonic-introduction-to-c-50eef9b023d7) where I present some basic scripts to get started with C++ if you have a python background.
## Set up
Just clone the repo and run the scripts with your C++ compiler of choice.
